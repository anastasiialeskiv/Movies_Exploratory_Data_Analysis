# Business Understanding
The goal of this project is to use data to deliver analysis to my client(Microsoft). Microsoft wants to know what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.After I worked with data, I built a visual presentation to show 3 recommendations for creating a successful movie. I want to show what would be the best type of films to create. I want to investigate the average budget, duration,language and genres to make future predictions and recommendations for my client. Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I am charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.
# Data Understanding
Dataset contains thousands of data points. The data files provide information about movies their rating, domestic gross and foreign gross. I checked which are the Top 3 most profitable movies? Average runtime,budget,domestic gross and worldwide gross of movies? Movies which are rated above 8 by the critics? Which year did we have the most profitable movies? What are the top genres?

## Data Preparation
CSV for reading CSV file

Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

# Exploratory Data Analysis

# Conclusion
After doing this data analysis I came out with some very interesting facts about movies. I found out what the average budget, duration,language,genre should be. What are the top 5 popular movies, what made them successful. I analyze the top 3 most profitable movies and year in this dataset. All this information helped me to make recommendations to my client what criteria should Microsoft follow to make a successful movie. If follow all the recommendations, the average worldwide gross should be around 91 million dollars and domestic profit around 41 million dollars.

## Limitation
I wish I had some more information about actors so I could decide who should be in the movie. Because as we know actors are a very important criteria of the movie.

## Recomendations
To make a successful movie the average budget must be around 31 million dollars. Average duration of the movie must be around 104 minutes The language has to be English Genre must be : Action, Adventure, Comedy ,Drama,Family,Fiction or Triller.

## Next Steps
My next step in the development of this topic would be finding more information about directors and writers.
